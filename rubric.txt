This is the rubric from a potential assignment/evaluation. I am assuming it is for a rock/paper/scissors game.

Criteria 1: Border: Click on the image displays a thick border

Criteria 2: play() function:
-random computer choice 1
 -obtain player choice 1
 -compare player and computer choices / return values 1
 -code quality and conciseness


 Criteria 3:  Click on the image plays the game and displays the result

 Criteria 4: Play again button - reset game (player and computer images, play again button)

 Criteria 5: General code quality and style, includes: - code formatting and readability - variable names - no duplicate code (use a function instead)
